Context ontology has the concepts and relations for representing multi-context data faced in construction and renovation project: planned and actual values, as-designed and as-built models, or designs in different levels of detail. The representation is based on the use of the named graphs of RDF datasets, which is an economical mechanism compatible with the nature of engineering data that is produced in a systematic fashion and mostly as large datasets (models, plans) with similar metadata.  The metadata regarding designs and plans is associated to named graphs, as well as the unit frameworks used in them.
