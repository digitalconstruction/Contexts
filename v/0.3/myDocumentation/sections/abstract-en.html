<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Context ontology provides the basic representation mechanisms for multi-context information that is commonplace in the construction domain: planned and actual values, as-designed and as-built models, and different levels of detail/development. The ontology allows the definition of different context frameworks, to create contexts within the frameworks, associate content to contexts, and to compare objects and values across contexts. At the implementation level, the content is stored in the named graphs of an RDF Dataset and the representation of context frameworks and contexts are managed in the default graph of the RDF Dataset. Since named graphs have identifiers, they can be associated with relevant metadata, such as provenance information or unit frameworks.
