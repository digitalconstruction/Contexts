<p>
The Digital Construction Contexts contain the definitions to maintain different realms of
information, for instance, information about
<ul>
  <li>as-is, as-designed, as-built and as-maintained models,</li>
  <li>planned versus actual execution of activities,</li>
  <li>models containing information up to a specific LOD level,</li>
  <li>plans for alternative construction methods or renovation scenarios.</li>
</ul>
</p>

The central class is <tt>dicc:Context</tt> that through <tt>dicc:hasContent</tt> refers to a <em>named graph</em> (of an <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset">RDF dataset</a>). Each different
model, version, or plan needs to have its own context; as a result its data is contained is a
separate named graph, which makes it possible to separate actual values from planned values, etc. 
</p>

<p>
Contexts are thematically organized into context frameworks (<tt>dicc:ContextFrameworks</tt>). An
example is the USA BIMForum LOD framework. Different contexts can be active at different
situations, which can be represented with context sets (<tt>dicc:ContextSet</tt>). For example,
there can be a default context set that specifies the currently active contexts. There can also be
context sets for different milestones that specify the context that were active at the time of the
milestone.
