To capture the evolution of construction data during a project, each
value is associated with a context. The content of a context is contained
in multiple named graphs. Each piece of RDF data - that is, an RDF
statement or a triple - belongs to a particular graph. The same
property of a same object can have multiple different values belonging
to different graphs.
