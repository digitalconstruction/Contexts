Construction and renovation projects are characterized the evolution of information over the duration of their
execution. The designs start from abstract requirements and proceeds to increasingly refined models, also branching
according to different disciplines (architectural design, structural engineering, and so on). Various – and potentially
also evolving – groupings of the entities are defined for different tasks such as procurement, transportation and
installation. Moreover, the planning of the work starts from high-level objectives and constraints, and proceeds from
project plans and master schedules to phase schedules, lookahead plans and weekly plans.
</p>
<p>
In the both refinement dimensions – design and planning – each successive level refines the information contained in the
previous level by adding new information about the entities that already existed, and also add new entities, typically
as substructure of the already specified entities at the previous refinement levels. The amount of information can grow
many times over from one level to the next. In practice, each level also introduces incompatible changes such as
removing existing entities or giving revised values to properties.
</p>
<p>
In the design area these stages of refinement – or levels of detail/development – have been specified as different LOD
frameworks, most containing prespecified levels with unambiguous content requirements. In the planning domain, the
levels are usually more loosely defined and based on prevailing practices. It should be noted that if plans are created
in reference to building objects or spaces, the plans will also depend on the design information. That is, a particular
plan may be based on design information at a particular level of refinement.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the refinement of information, renovation and construction projects are also characterized by unexpected
and unplanned changes that create a need to change designs or plans. Consequently, there will be additional contexts of
information that are dynamically created during the execution. The change management needs apply both to BIM models and
construction plans, as well as some other relevant organizing information, such as breakdown structures.
</p>
<p>
This all means that renovation projects are characterized by a very complex structure of information contexts consisting of 
independently developing but interdependent threads of refinement (design and plans are refined separately but plans depend on designs),
partly predefined and partly dynamic set of contexts in each thread.
</p>
<p>
There are multiple alternative ways to represent multi-context data in RDF from explicit ontology-level modelling of
qualified properties such as in PROV-O (Lebo, 2013) or BFO-ISO (BFO-ISO, 2019), generic objectified properties such as
in OPM (Rasmussen, 2018), RDF reification (Brickley, 2014), singleton properties (Nguyen, 2014), and various ways of
using the named graphs of RDF Dataset such as nanopublications (Groth, 2010) or OVOpub (Callahan, 2013).
</p>
<p>
The model adopted in this ontology is based on the last approach, the utilization of named graphs of RDF Datasets. The
reason is that since construction is an organized engineering-oriented discipline,
</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are usually large datasets whose entities belong to the same context and have the same provenance
  information (BIM models, construction plans, breakdown structures);
  </li>
  <li>The static property metadata (such as quantity kinds, units of measurement, and tolerances) is similar
  throughout the same dataset for the same properties, since they are results of organized design, engineering or
  management work.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The ontology is therefore based on the following principles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each dataset is stored into a separate named graph of an RDF dataset. If the dataset contains data that has
  different origin or different context – such as different LOD level – the dataset needs to be split into several
  parts, each of which has the same context and provenance, that are stored in separate named graphs.
  </li>
  <li>The context, provenance and property metadata are recorded at the graph level. This is possible since a graph has
  an identity (a URI) which can be associated with information. This metadata is stored in the default graph of the RDF
  dataset.
  </li>
  <li>Proper ontologies for metadata are used to enable the representation of the contexts together with their mutual
  relations, the provenance of the data and the relevant property metadata at graph level.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This solution makes it possible to manage context-related data about any entities and any properties in a transparent
and orthogonal manner. Moreover, many Semantic Web tools work well with this model: RDF databases support it, there is a
standard serialization format called Trig (Bizer, 2014) – that is based on Turtle (Prud'hommeaux, 2014) – for
serializing RDF datasets containing named graphs, and SPARQL has constructs to make queries to specific named graphs or
to record the named graph in which an RDF statement (a triple) belongs to. Finally, the graph-level representation is
extremely economic in terms of the storage capacity.
